## Overview
*DA project for the gym Model Fitness (Using ML skills). The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.
One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. How do we know if a customer is no longer with you? We can calculate churn based on people who get rid of their accounts or don't renew their contracts. However, sometimes it's not obvious that a client has left: they may walk out on tiptoes.
Churn indicators vary from field to field. If a user buys from an online store rarely but regularly, we can't say they're a runaway. But if for two weeks they haven't opened a channel that's updated daily, that's a reason to worry: our follower might have gotten bored and left us.
For a gym, it makes sense to say a customer has left if they don't come for a month. Of course, it's possible they're in Cancun and will resume their visits when they return, but's that's not a typical case. Usually, if a customer joins, comes a few times, then disappears, they're unlikely to come back.
In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. Your task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.
